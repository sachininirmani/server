    <h1>Welcome to My PHP Website</h1>
    <p>This is the default welcome page served by the web server.</p>
    <h1>How this server works? </h1>

    <p><br> URL -  <a href="http://localhost:2728/index.php">http://localhost:2728/index.php</a> can be used to access this website.
    (you are currently here.)

    <br><br>when you type <a href="http://localhost:2728/">http://localhost:2728/</a> ,
    <br> server converts it as <a href="http://localhost:2728/index.php">http://localhost:2728/index.php</a> also.

    <br><br> to add two numbers type url - <a href="http://localhost:2728/add_numbers_form.html">http://localhost:2728/add_numbers_form.html</a> in the browser.
    

    <br><br>this would take you to a html page where you can submit two numbers to add.

    <br><br>clicking add would take you to http://localhost:2728/add_numbers.php with the given two parameters.

    <br><br>or you can directly access said php file (http://localhost:2728/add_numbers.php) with two params for num1 and num2. 

    <br><br>The URL should look like <a href="http://localhost:2728/add_numbers.php?num1=4&num2=3">http://localhost:2728/add_numbers.php?num1=4&num2=3</a>
            if the given two numbers are 4 and 3. 
    <br><br>this would show the results of addition.
